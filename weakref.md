- see `asyncio.task.Task._all_tasks`, use `weakref` to cache object
> A primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding large objects, 
where itâ€™s desired that a large object not be kept alive solely because it appears in a cache or mapping

*read [this](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/weak_dict.html) later!*

- see `copy.deepcopy.memo`, use `d = {hash: result} to cache result

- for a copy to modify , use `copy.deepcopy`
